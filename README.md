# Go Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, 
allowing multiple observers to be notified of changes in a subject. 

This Go implementation of the Observer Pattern provides a simple and efficient way to manage observers and notify them of changes in the subject.
